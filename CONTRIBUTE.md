# Contribute

Hey there! We’re stoked to hear that you’re interested in contributing to Bitcoin Layers. Here’s a few immediate needs where we need support.

## Reviewing risk assessments

We think we have a pretty good handle on the risk assessments. But, an extra set of eyes is always helpful. If you have a technical understanding on how Bitcoin scaling protocols operate, please consider joining on our [telegram chat](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh) and ask which risk assessments are in the “review” stage. You can also review our published risk assessments [here](https://github.com/bitcoinlayers/bitcoinlayers/tree/main/content).

## Reviewing our risk framework

Defining L2s can seem like an impossible job. We’re confident [in our definitions and risk framework](https://bitcoin-layers.gitbook.io/untitled/), but acknowledge that it can be improved in some areas. If you have thoughts on our framework, please consider joining our [telegram chat](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh) and offering feedback.

## Community note taker

We host weekly community calls and are considering expanding to more community-centric content. We would need someone to take really in-depth notes during more structured calls to ensure that community members who could not attend can stay up to date. If someone wanted to completely own this role, the time commitment would be 4-5 hours a month. We currently host/coordinate community calls in our [telegram chat](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh).

## Writing risk assessments

A lot of the new “L2s” that are popping up are similar to Ethereum rollups / validiums / optimiums. If you have a technical understanding of these protocols, and would like to review some of their implementations in the Bitcoin space, [please join our telegram](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh) so we can coordinate which reviews you can take on :)

## Opinion blog pieces

We’re going to start hosting opinion pieces on our blog. If you’d like to write a blog related to Bitcoin scaling infrastructure, and have it featured on our site, [let us know](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh)!

## Just join the conversation

Not every contribution can be measured by GitHub commits. Simply jumping [into our chat](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh) and being a part of the discussion is super valuable and appreciated. You may also be able to contribute to a project in a capacity that is not listed here. If that's the case, [let us know](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh). :)

## Website maintenance for bitcoinlayers.org

Follow existing variable and file naming standards, and make sure to run `npm run format` to format with prettier.
