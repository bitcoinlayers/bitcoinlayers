    "description": "Starknet is a validity rollup on Ethereum. They are proposing that their rollup also settles on Bitcoin if the OP_CAT opcode is activated. The proposed design would see the rollup have two validating bridges: one on Ethereum, the other on Bitcoin. They are currently developing a STARK verifier directly in Script with OP_CAT on signet.",

The first enables users to predefine spending conditions for individual UTXOs. The second primitive is the verification of merkle tree branches. This would enable you to continuously add hashes of data to a merkle tree that continuously builds upon restrictions placed by previous transactions.\n\nBy building a continuous chain of restrictions over a number of transactions, you enable recursive covenants. Recursive covenants enable users to lock funds into a group UTXO that can continuously add more restrictions based on new user deposits, and additionally enforce that change from partial withdrawals must go back into the rollup script."

The StarkWare team (lead developers of Starknet) are working with L2 Iterative Ventures on developing a STARK verifier directly in Bitcoin Script with OP_CAT.\n\nIn rollups, state differences are compressed together and sent to the Bitcoin L1 with a corresponding validity proof proving that the state transition was executed correctly. Starknet are proposing a mechanism that would verify these STARK proofs proving the validity of L2 state transitions. By verifying offchain state transitions directly in Script, shared UTXOs would be able to process user withdrawals based on their updated balances. Recursive covenants and onchain STARK verification would create trust-mimized bridge programs for L2s."

As a Turing-complete VM, other VMs, such as the Kakarot Type 4 zkEVM, can be emulated on Starknet."

Importantly, this model would allow for users to choose their preferred DA solution per transaction. High value per byte transactions would favor Ethereum DA, while low value per byte transactions would logically use alternative DA. This is particularly relevant for the move to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin DA is considerably more scarce than Ethereum blobspace."
