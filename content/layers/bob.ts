They have launched as a rollup on top of Ethereum, with plans to derive more security from Bitcoin miners, and full nodes, over time. Its relation to Bitcoin, currently, is similar to that of a sidechain as it is an alternative consensus protocol with a two-way peg(s) between it and the Bitcoin mainchain.",
