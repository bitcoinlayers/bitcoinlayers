Statechains enable the offchain transfer of UTXO ownership by transferring key shares from one entity to the next with support of a trusted third party, the statechain entity. A statecoin owner can unilaterally exit back to Bitcoin‚Äôs L1 network, given the statechain entity doesn‚Äôt collude with a previous statecoin owner. Mercury Layer utilizes an HSM server that leverages blind co-signing and key share updates. The system relies entirely on client-side software to manage the statechain transfer history and handle transaction validation.",

Second, the Mercury Layer server can update the key shares needed for co-signing. In the honest case, the server securely deletes previous key shares to not be able to collude with previous statecoin owners and steal the current owner's funds. \n In the Mercury Layer implementation, the operator uses an HSM for key handling and key deletion after cosigning each new holder's withdrawal transaction. This provides a stronger assurance (relative to not using an HSM) that the operator will not collude with a prior statecoin owner to sign a transaction transferring the statecoin. This is because the HSM deletes the key share needed to sign transactions after each use, and is otherwise inaccessible to the operator (assuming the HSM itself remains uncompromised).",

Therefore, all statechain verification processes need to be performed entirely by client-side software. During a statechain transfer, the number of server signatures is passed on to the recipient, who also learns about the full transfer history of the statechain from the previous owner. This data is timestamped by the server using the [mainstay](https://mainstay.xyz/about) protocol.

Mercury Layer recently developed an [atomic swap protocol](https://github.com/commerceblock/mercurylayer/blob/dev/docs/atomic_transfer.md#lightning-latch-transfer) called Lightning Latch that enables the atomic exchange of two statechains, which facilitates coinjoin-like exchange of assets as well as better interaction between statechains and the Lightning Network.
