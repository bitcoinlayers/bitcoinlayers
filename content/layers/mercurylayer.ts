        "Mercury Layer is an implementation of the statechain protocol. Statechains enable the offchain transfer of UTXO ownership by transferring key shares from one entity to the next with support of a trusted third party, the statechain entity. A statecoin owner can unilaterally exit back to Bitcoin’s L1 network, given the statechain entity doesn’t collude with a previous statecoin owner. Mercury Layer utilizes an HSM server that leverages blind co-signing and key share updates. The system relies entirely on client-side software to manage the statechain transfer history and handle transaction validation.",
