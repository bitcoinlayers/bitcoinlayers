    "description": "This review covers the Ark implementation written in Go (GitHub), running on the Liquid network. . A separate review for the covenant-less version of Ark (clArk) (GitHub) which operates on Bitcoin, will follow. Ark is a proposed payments protocol designed to shift liquidity requirements to a central operator, which is an always-on server, known as the Ark Service Provider (ASP). There are currently no ASPs supporting Ark on Liquid.",

One way the ASP could abuse this is to collude with parent chain block producers to delay the unilateral exit, so that the ASP can eventually claim users’ funds. Without the ASP colluding with the Liquid functionaries, a unilateral exit to Liquid is possible. Furthermore, as this implementation of Ark is running on Liquid, users trust that the respective functionaries operating the Liquid blockchain will include their on-chain withdrawals in a Liquid block."

Steps are: the ASP creates a round transaction with an additional output, locked by Alice (connector output). Then, the user signs a forfeit transaction which spends from the old VTXO and adds the connector output from the previously created round transaction. The ASP then broadcasts the round transaction, providing the user with a new UTXO. During a period of four weeks, the user could double spend their VTXO. Trying to do so results in the ASP gaining the ability to claim the users’ funds within a 24h window, using the forfeit transaction signed by the user.\n\nIn case of a non-cooperative exit, due to an unresponsive or malicious ASP, an Ark VTXO can be redeemed as a UTXO on the Liquid blockchain provided the ASP doesn’t collude with Liquid functionaries. A unilateral exit is triggered by the user through revealing the branch of the shared output that locks their funds. This ensures self-custody of Ark funds in relation to L-BTC, even though a third party is involved in transaction processing.\n\nTo process withdrawals from L-BTC back to BTC, users must either trust Liquid functionaries to process their withdrawals or perform a swap between BTC and L-BTC with a third party."

Connector outputs ensure that the ASP can only claim the users’ old VTXO if a new one has been created by the ASP as part of a new shared output.

Failing to do so results in the ASP being able to sweep users’ funds. Those funds will then be held custodially by the operator and can be claimed back by the user to be held again in a non-custodial fashion should the operator process their claim. To mitigate this, a watchtower-like solution is being proposed where a user can delegate VTXO refreshment."
