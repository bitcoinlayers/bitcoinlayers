Cairoâ€™s Turing-completeness allows it to emulate other VMs, which can then inherit provable characteristics on Starknet.

The StarkWare team (lead developers of Starknet) are working with L2 Iterative Ventures on developing a STARK verifier directly in Bitcoin Script with OP_CAT.\n\nIn rollups, state differences are compressed together and sent to the Bitcoin L1 with a corresponding validity proof proving that the state transition was executed correctly. Starknet are proposing a mechanism that would verify these STARK proofs proving the validity of L2 state transitions. By verifying offchain state transitions directly in Script, shared UTXOs would be able to process user withdrawals based on their updated balances.

This is known as based sequencing. If Bitcoin rollups implemented based sequencing, miners could invest into more sophisticated block building infrastructure to extract more harmful MEV for increased profits. This could raise the barrier to entry for mining, and potentially introduce centralizing pressures.\n\nStarknet is currently sequenced (ordered) by a centralized sequencer. The Starknet community has additionally researched decentralized sequencer, but have focused on alternative consensus protocols taking on this role (CometBFT as an example).\n\nIf an alternative consensus mechanism is used to decentralize the sequencer, versus based sequencing, then MEV is unlikely to leak to Bitcoin miners.",
