    "description": "The concept of blind signatures and electronic cash was first introduced by David Chaum in 1982 in his paper titled “[Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments](https://chaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Chaum-blind-signatures.pdf)“. Cashu is an Ecash protocol based on [David Wagner’s variant of Chaumian blinding](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) which uses the [Blind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (blind ecash) scheme](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/be7a4760dd4596d06963d67baf140406). It was [first introduced](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1569986110272540674) in 2022 by its creator Calle, a pseudonymous Bitcoin and Lightning Network developer. Cashu is an open-source protocol with well-defined specifications, called [NUTs (Notation, Usage, and Terminology)](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts), which are followed by mints and wallets. An Ecash system consists of two parts, the mint and the Ecash wallet that stores digital bearer tokens. Anyone can run a mint for their application, be it a wallet, a web paywall, paid streaming services or a voucher and rewards system. There are [several libraries](https://docs.cashu.space/libraries) that allow developers to build their respective services. Using blind signatures assures users’ privacy towards the mint when transacting with Ecash tokens. This functionality allows building custodial Bitcoin services that provide a superior user experience and privacy.",

Those tokens act as IOUs and are backed by BTC. It can be thought of as “[free banking](https://docs.cashu.space/faq#mints)”, where the bank issued their own bank notes that are backed by gold for example. Having mints hold users’ funds, requires the user to trust the mint to redeem their Ecash when they wish to convert back to BTC. Peg-ins and peg-outs to and from a Cashu mint happen through the Lightning Network. The LN infrastructure is run by the mints themselves or by public and untrusted Lightning gateways (Cashu wallets are not LN wallets). The blinding mechanism ensures that the mint operator remains unaware of users’ account balance or transaction data. While the mint stays unaware of its user base in the current implementation, [an optional authentication protocol will be added](https://x.com/CashuBTC/status/1791001643019809146) to the protocol that allows mints to control access to its services. This authentication protocol enables KYC/AML integration with Ecash. Every entity running a Lightning node can run a mint using one of the [available implementations](https://docs.cashu.space/mints). The easiest way to do so is via [Nutshell](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell)."

To receive Cashu tokens, the user has two choices: 1. The user can pay a Lightning invoice issued by its [mint of choice](https://bitcoinmints.com/), which hands out the Ecash tokens in return. 2. The user receives Ecash from another user. Each mint issues their own tokens."

To prevent double-spending, the recipient needs to immediately swap its token for a new one with the help of the respective mint. However, if it’s a [P2PK locked token](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md), the sender can’t double-spend; the receiver can even be offline and swap at a later point in time. Using a Cashu wallet, and the sender and recipient are using the same mint (a user can use as many mints as desired), results in a seamless process where the mint simply melts the senders’ token and mints a new one for the recipient. Inter-mint transfers are facilitated through the “[Multimint Swap functionality](https://docs.cashu.space/faq#mints)”, which operates via Lightning invoices under the hood. A Lightning MPP (Multi-Path Payment) equivalent, called “Multinut Payments” has [recently been implemented](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1793554488806248839) in Cashu via [NUT15](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/15.md).

[Numerous Cashu wallets](https://docs.cashu.space/wallets) are available: native app wallets, web wallets and headless CLI wallets. They all adhere to the mandatory [Cashu NUTs](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts) to ensure standardization and security. They differ for example in Tor support, nostr integration and add different of the optional NUT specifications. For easy integration of Cashu payments into any application, a [CDK](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk) is being developed.
