The custodian could also deposit the wrapped BTC tokens into another staking protocol that takes the liquidity. The trust assumptions related to these scenarios are dependent on the custodians and protocols involved.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è A noted vulnerability in uniBTC is that if a specific wrapped BTC token became unbacked (e.g. wBTC), the uniBTC peg would be broken.
