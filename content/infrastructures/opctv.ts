                        "OP_CAT is a proposed opcode that could enable two primitives that would support improved bridging protocols for projects like Starknet. The first enables users to predefine spending conditions for individual UTXOs. The second primitive is the verification of merkle tree branches. This would enable you to continuously add hashes of data to a merkle tree that continuously builds upon restrictions placed by previous transactions.\n\nBy building a continuous chain of restrictions over a number of transactions, you enable recursive covenants. Recursive covenants enable users to lock funds into a group UTXO that can continuously add more restrictions based on new user deposits, and additionally enforce changes for partial withdrawals which must go back into the rollup script.",

                        "An issue that arises from shared UTXOs, specifically for L2s, is that you need a trusted party to verify offchain state transitions to enable users to withdraw funds relative to their updated balance. The StarkWare team (lead developers of Starknet) are working with L2 Iterative Ventures on developing a STARK verifier directly in Bitcoin Script with OP_CAT.\n\nIn rollups, state differences are compressed together and sent to the Bitcoin L1 with a corresponding validity proof proving that the state transition was executed correctly. Starknet are proposing a mechanism that would verify these STARK proofs proving the validity of L2 state transitions. By verifying offchain state transitions directly in Script, shared UTXOs would be able to process user withdrawals based on their updated balances. Recursive covenants and onchain STARK verification would create trust-minimized bridge programs for L2s.",
