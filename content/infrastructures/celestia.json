Scaling protocols that want to save costs on data availability can integrate with Celestia for improved performance with some additional tradeoffs. Celestia is based on CometBFT and additionally supports Data Availablity Sampling (DAS), a mechanism by which anyone running a light client can verify that the Celestia network is making rollup state data available.",
