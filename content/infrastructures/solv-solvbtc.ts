They also trust the various operators of other BTC-derivative assets acting as reserve assets with SolvBTC to remain pegged 1:1 with BTC. If any of these derivative assets became unbacked, then SolvBTC's peg with BTC could be broken.\n\nUsers trust Solv's claims in their documentation are being executed in practice.\n\n[Source](https://solvprotocol.medium.com/introducing-solvbtc-the-first-ever-yield-bearing-bitcoin-871179c73ca6)",
