    <p>Some context related to risks with certain protocols may not be covered directly in our risk assessment.

    const summaryBody = `
    <p>This framework can be easier to customize and provide more nuance given the number of scaling solutions that are present in Bitcoin today. For example, related to block production/network operators, we can add even more scoring mechanisms based on how decentralized the network is. E.g. A network with 200 validators is better than a network with 10, and we can customize the assessment to highlight this.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This risk assessment is an initial starting point to analyze Bitcoin scaling protocols. It is a living document and is subject to change.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Bitcoin does not have a unified scaling roadmap. There are tradeoffs with every protocol being implemented to support Bitcoin scaling. This framework hopes to capture some of the nuance related to the various designs being proposed.</p>
