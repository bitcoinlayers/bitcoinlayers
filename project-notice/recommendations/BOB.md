BOB is an implementation of a rollup to Ethereum.

For BOB to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Create a federated two-way peg for an official BTC derivative asset: The majority of BOB's BTC TVL is managed by centralized custodians or is third-party derivative assets locked in an immediately upgradeable bridge contract. We recommend that the protocol implements a public, federated two way peg. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found here.
- Initially enable users to pay gas fees in a BTC-denominated token by June 30th. Then reconfigure the sequencer fees to be denominated in BTC backed by a federated two-way peg.

These are the minimum requirements as BOB works towards adding bitcoin fault proofs.
