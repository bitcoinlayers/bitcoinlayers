The Bitcoin Layers team has reviewed a number of projects that claim to be a bitcoin layer. We have decided to categorize projects into the following categories:

- Bitcoin native, a protocol where a user retains custody of their funds and can exit the system if their counterparty goes offline
- Sidesystem, an alternative blockchain, with a two-way peg, that has a direction connection to bitcoin or enables users to interact with L1 scripts
- Alternative, an alternative blockchain that has no connection to bitcoin, but supports BTC derivative assets

A number of protocols that claim to be bitcoin layers do not meet our requirements for being a sidesystem. We have listed recommendations for each project below.

- Merlin Chain
- Bsquared Network
- Core
- BitLayer
- BOB
- Rollux
- BEVM
- Libre
- Fractal
