Libre is a layer 1 blockchain built on Substrate.

For Libre to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Publish the full signer set for its upcoming two-way peg with bitcoin. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found here.
- Introduce a checkpointing mechanism so malicious, Libre validators cannot reorg the chain after a checkpoint has been accepted.

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see here.
