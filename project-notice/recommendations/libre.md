Libre is a layer 1 blockchain built on EOSIO. We have removed it from the main site due to it no longer having a functioning peg with BTC.

For Libre to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Implement and publish the full signer set for its current two-way peg with bitcoin. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).
- Introduce a checkpointing mechanism so malicious, Libre validators cannot reorg the chain after a checkpoint has been accepted.

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see [here](https://www.lxresearch.co/starting-to-define-layers-a-year-later/).
