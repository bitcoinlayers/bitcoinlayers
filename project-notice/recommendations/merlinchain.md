Merlin chain is an implementation of a rollup to a permissioned DA layer. It is denominated in BTC.

For Merlin to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Create a federated two-way peg for MerlBTC and wBTC: The majority of Merlin's BTC TVL is managed by a centralized custodian. We recommend that the protocol implements a public, federated two way peg. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).
- Publish the members of its DA layer and chain hosting its L1 rollup contracts. Our requirements are there at least 5 individual validators external to the development organization in a federated model.

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see [here](https://www.lxresearch.co/starting-to-define-layers-a-year-later/).
