Bitlayer is a federated layer 1 blockchain.

For Bitlayer to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Publish the full signer set for the two-way peg for wBTC. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).
- Publish the full validator set for the Bitlayer L1 or make the validator role open. Our requirements are there at least 5 individual validators external to the development organization in a federated model.

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see [here](https://www.lxresearch.co/starting-to-define-layers-a-year-later/).
