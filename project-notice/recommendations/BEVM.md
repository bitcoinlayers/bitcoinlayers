BEVM is a layer 1 blockchain built on Substrate. It is denominated in BTC.

For BEVM to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Publish the full signer set for the two-way peg for wBTC. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found here.

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see here.
