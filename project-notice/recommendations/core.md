Core chain is a layer 1 blockchain with hybrid PoS/PoW consensus.

For Core to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Publish the signers of the two-way peg for coreBTC. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found here.
- Clearly document L1 staking scripts to enable L1 users to remotely assign BTC to Core validators.

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see here.
