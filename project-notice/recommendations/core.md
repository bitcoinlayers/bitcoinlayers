Core chain is a layer 1 blockchain with hybrid PoS/PoW consensus.

For Core to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Publish the signers of the two-way peg for the upcoming LstBTC. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).
- Clearly document L1 staking scripts to enable L1 users to remotely assign BTC to Core validators -> **This has been met.**

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see [here](https://www.lxresearch.co/starting-to-define-layers-a-year-later/).
