Rollux is an OP stack rollup that uses Syscoin, a merge-mined chain, for data availability.

For Rollux to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Create a federated two-way peg for an official BTC derivative asset: The Rollux's BTC TVL is managed by centralized custodians. We recommend that the protocol implements a public, federated two way peg. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see [here](https://www.lxresearch.co/starting-to-define-layers-a-year-later/).
