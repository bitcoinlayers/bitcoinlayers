Fractal is a blockchain that is partially merge-mined by bitcoin.

For Fractal to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Publish the signers of the Unisat two-way peg: The majority of Fractal's BTC TVL is managed by centralized parties. We recommend that the protocol implements a public, federated two way peg. Our requirements see at least 5 individual signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).

For more information on how we define sidesystems, and our minimum technical requirements, see [here](https://www.lxresearch.co/starting-to-define-layers-a-year-later/).
