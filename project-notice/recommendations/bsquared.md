Bsquared Network is an implementation of a rollup to a permissioned DA layer. It is denominated in BTC.

For Bsquared Network to be considered a bitcoin sidesystem, we recommend the following upgrades:

- Create a federated two-way peg for wBTC: The majority of Bsquared's BTC TVL is managed by a centralized custodian. We recommend that the protocol implements a public, federated two way peg. Our requirements see at least individual 5 signers external to the development organization. An example of this can be found [here](https://bitcoinl2labs.com/sbtc-rollout#sbtc-signers).
- Distribute operations of the B2Hub L1 to at least 5 validators external to the development organization.

Another recommendation we have for the Bsquared network team is to provide clearer documentation on various L1 smart contracts and verify them on the Bsquared Hub explorer.
