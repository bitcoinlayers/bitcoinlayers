Those tokens act as IOUs and are backed by BTC. Having mints hold users’ funds, requires the user to trust the mint to redeem their Ecash when they wish to convert back to BTC. Peg-ins and peg-outs to and from a Cashu mint happen through the Lightning Network. The LN infrastructure is run by the mints themselves or by public and untrusted Lightning gateways (Cashu wallets are not LN wallets). The blinding mechanism ensures that the mint operator remains unaware of users’ account balance or transaction data. Every entity running a Lightning node can run a mint using one of the [available implementations](https://docs.cashu.space/mints).

To receive Cashu tokens, the user has two choices: 1. The user can pay a Lightning invoice issued by its [mint of choice](https://bitcoinmints.com/), which hands out the Ecash tokens in return. 2. The user receives Ecash from another user. Each mint issues their own tokens.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Token Transfer\",\n                    content:\n                        \"The mentioned data string (aka Cashu token) can be sent via any Cashu-enabled wallet (even [offline](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1796071406624465113)) or via any messaging-supportive medium (e.g. telegram, nostr protocol, .., even [radio](https://x.com/jurbed/status/1748485334210396506)). To prevent double-spending, the recipient needs to immediately swap its token for a new one with the help of the respective mint. However, if it’s a [P2PK locked token](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md), the sender can’t double-spend; the receiver can even be offline and swap at a later point in time. Using a Cashu wallet, and the sender and recipient are using the same mint (a user can use as many mints as desired), results in a seamless process where the mint simply melts the senders’ token and mints a new one for the recipient. Inter-mint transfers are facilitated through the “[Multimint Swap functionality](https://docs.cashu.space/faq#mints)”, which operates via Lightning invoices under the hood. A Lightning MPP (Multi-Path Payment) equivalent, called “Multinut Payments” has [recently been implemented](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1793554488806248839) in Cashu via [NUT15](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/15.md).
