To create leaves, users work with the statechain entity to create a pre-signed, bitcoin transaction that takes the parent UTXO as the input, and produces multiple outputs each controlled by a new key. These keyshares are split from the previous private key. Users can spend these leaves to new recipients or further split them into smaller denominations as needed. Users should note that leaves, which are split futher from the parent UTXO, will have increased unilateral exit costs compared to a leaf that is one branch away from the parent UTXO.\",\n                         collapsible: true,\n                         buttonText: \"Learn how Spark leverages vUTXOs and splits them\",\n                         expandable: false,\n                         linkText: \"Learn more about leaf splitting in the Spark docs\",\n                         linkUrl: \"https://docs.spark.money/spark/technical-definitions\",\n                     },\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Relative timelocks\",\n                    content: `Spark leverages relative timelocks to ensure that the current owner can spend their unilateral exit transaction before the previous owner.`,\n                },\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            id: \"usecases\",\n            title: \"Use Cases\",\n            content: [\n                {\n                    title: \"Offchain UTXO transfers\",\n                    content: UseCaseSnippet.OffchainUTXOTransfers,\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Tokenized applications\",\n                    content: UseCaseSnippet.UTXOTokenizedApplications,\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Lightning compatible\",\n                    content: UseCaseSnippet.LightningCompatible,\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n        {\n            id: \"knowledgeBits\",\n            title: \"Knowledge Bits\",\n            content: [\n                {\n                    title: \"Learn more about statechains below\",\n                    content:\n                        \"[Statechains are L2s, by the Bitcoin Layers team](https://x.com/BitcoinLayers/status/1925586374473724392) \\n [Statechains Whitepaper, by Ruben Somsen](https://github.com/RubenSomsen/rubensomsen.github.io/blob/master/img/statechains.pdf) \\n [Statechains: Non-custodial Off-chain Bitcoin Transfer, by Ruben Somsen](https://medium.com/@RubenSomsen/statechains-non-custodial-off-chain-bitcoin-transfer-1ae4845a4a39#:~:text=Statechains%20are%20a%20layer%20two,with%20scaling%20and%20save%20fees.) \\n [Information on FROST from the Blockstream team](https://glossary.blockstream.com/frost/)\",\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n    ],\n};\n\nexport default spark;\n","import {\n    LayerProject,\n    Type,\n    LiveStatus,\n    RiskFactor,\n    EntityType,\n    EntityCategory,\n    Notice,\n    Site,\n    RiskSection,\n    ContentSection,\n    RiskCategory,\n    TokenSnippet,\n    ReviewSnippet,\n    BitcoinSecuritySnippet,\n    RiskSummarySnippet,\n    CustodyTitle,\n} from \"../props\";\n\nconst stacks: LayerProject = {\n    type: Type.Layer,\n    slug: \"stacks\",\n    title: \"Stacks\",\n    entityType: EntityType.Anchor,\n    entityCategory: EntityCategory.Sidesystem,\n    custodyTitle: CustodyTitle.Distributed,\n    live: LiveStatus.Mainnet,\n    staking: false,\n    liquidStaking: false,\n    bridge: false,\n    underReview: false,\n    riskFactors: [\n        RiskFactor.VeryHigh,\n        RiskFactor.Medium,\n        RiskFactor.Medium,\n        RiskFactor.Low,\n    ],\n    btcLocked: 1054,\n    nativeToken: \"STX\",\n    feeToken: \"STX\",\n    notice: undefined,\n    bitcoinOnly: false,\n    links: [\n        {\n            text: Site.Website,\n            url: \"https://www.stacks.co\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.Docs,\n            url: \"https://docs.stacks.co/docs/intro\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.Explorer,\n            url: \"https://explorer.hiro.so/transactions?chain=mainnet\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.GitHub,\n            url: \"https://github.com/stacks-network\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.Twitter,\n            url: \"https://x.com/Stacks\",\n        },\n    ],\n    description:\n        \"Stacks is a sidechain that aims to be programmability layer for Bitcoin.
