To create leaves, users work with the statechain entity to create a pre-signed, bitcoin transaction that takes the parent UTXO as the input, and produces multiple outputs each controlled by a new key. These keyshares are split from the previous private key. Users can spend these leaves to new recipients or further split them into smaller denominations as needed. Users should note that leaves, which are split futher from the parent UTXO, will have increased unilateral exit costs compared to a leaf that is one branch away from the parent UTXO.\",\n                         collapsible: true,\n                         buttonText: \"Learn how Spark leverages vUTXOs and splits them\",\n                         expandable: false,\n                         linkText: \"Learn more about leaf splitting in the Spark docs\",\n                         linkUrl: \"https://docs.spark.money/spark/technical-definitions\",\n                     },\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Relative timelocks\",\n                    content: `Spark leverages relative timelocks to ensure that the current owner can spend their unilateral exit transaction before the previous owner.`,\n                },\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            id: \"usecases\",\n            title: \"Use Cases\",\n            content: [\n                {\n                    title: \"Offchain UTXO transfers\",\n                    content: UseCaseSnippet.OffchainUTXOTransfers,\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Tokenized applications\",\n                    content: UseCaseSnippet.UTXOTokenizedApplications,\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Lightning compatible\",\n                    content: UseCaseSnippet.LightningCompatible,\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n        {\n            id: \"knowledgeBits\",\n            title: \"Knowledge Bits\",\n            content: [\n                {\n                    title: \"Learn more about statechains below\",\n                    content:\n                        \"[Statechains are L2s, by the Bitcoin Layers team](https://x.com/BitcoinLayers/status/1925586374473724392) \\n [Statechains Whitepaper, by Ruben Somsen](https://github.com/RubenSomsen/rubensomsen.github.io/blob/master/img/statechains.pdf) \\n [Statechains: Non-custodial Off-chain Bitcoin Transfer, by Ruben Somsen](https://medium.com/@RubenSomsen/statechains-non-custodial-off-chain-bitcoin-transfer-1ae4845a4a39#:~:text=Statechains%20are%20a%20layer%20two,with%20scaling%20and%20save%20fees.) \\n [Information on FROST from the Blockstream team](https://glossary.blockstream.com/frost/)\",\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n    ],\n};\n\nexport default spark;\n","import {\n    LayerProject,\n    Type,\n    LiveStatus,\n    RiskFactor,\n    EntityType,\n    EntityCategory,\n    Notice,\n    Site,\n    RiskSection,\n    ContentSection,\n    RiskCategory,\n    TokenSnippet,\n    ReviewSnippet,\n    BitcoinSecuritySnippet,\n    RiskSummarySnippet,\n    CustodyTitle,\n} from \"../props\";\n\nconst stacks: LayerProject = {\n    type: Type.Layer,\n    slug: \"stacks\",\n    title: \"Stacks\",\n    entityType: EntityType.Anchor,\n    entityCategory: EntityCategory.Sidesystem,\n    custodyTitle: CustodyTitle.Distributed,\n    live: LiveStatus.Mainnet,\n    staking: false,\n    liquidStaking: false,\n    bridge: false,\n    underReview: false,\n    riskFactors: [\n        RiskFactor.VeryHigh,\n        RiskFactor.Medium,\n        RiskFactor.Medium,\n        RiskFactor.Low,\n    ],\n    btcLocked: 1054,\n    nativeToken: \"STX\",\n    feeToken: \"STX\",\n    notice: undefined,\n    bitcoinOnly: false,\n    links: [\n        {\n            text: Site.Website,\n            url: \"https://www.stacks.co\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.Docs,\n            url: \"https://docs.stacks.co/docs/intro\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.Explorer,\n            url: \"https://explorer.hiro.so/transactions?chain=mainnet\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.GitHub,\n            url: \"https://github.com/stacks-network\",\n        },\n        {\n            text: Site.Twitter,\n            url: \"https://x.com/Stacks\",\n        },\n    ],\n    description:\n        \"Stacks is a sidechain that aims to be programmability layer for Bitcoin.

Those tokens act as IOUs and are backed by BTC. Having mints hold users’ funds, requires the user to trust the mint to redeem their Ecash when they wish to convert back to BTC. Peg-ins and peg-outs to and from a Cashu mint happen through the Lightning Network. The LN infrastructure is run by the mints themselves or by public and untrusted Lightning gateways (Cashu wallets are not LN wallets). The blinding mechanism ensures that the mint operator remains unaware of users’ account balance or transaction data. Every entity running a Lightning node can run a mint using one of the [available implementations](https://docs.cashu.space/mints). The easiest way to do so is via [Nutshell](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell).\",\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Token Issuance\",\n                    content:\n                        \"While Ecash itself is an IOU from the mint towards the user, Ecash tokens itself are bearer instruments, which means that the holder of the bearer instrument - in this case a [mere data string](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfYmwc-gnK8&t=379s) - is presumed to be the owner of the asset. To receive Cashu tokens, the user has two choices: 1. The user can pay a Lightning invoice issued by its [mint of choice](https://bitcoinmints.com/), which hands out the Ecash tokens in return. 2. The user receives Ecash from another user. Each mint issues their own tokens.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    title: \"Token Transfer\",\n                    content:\n                        \"The mentioned data string (aka Cashu token) can be sent via any Cashu-enabled wallet (even [offline](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1796071406624465113)) or via any messaging-supportive medium (e.g. telegram, nostr protocol, .., even [radio](https://x.com/jurbed/status/1748485334210396506)). To prevent double-spending, the recipient needs to immediately swap its token for a new one with the help of the respective mint. However, if it’s a [P2PK locked token](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md), the sender can’t double-spend; the receiver can even be offline and swap at a later point in time. Using a Cashu wallet, and the sender and recipient are using the same mint (a user can use as many mints as desired), results in a seamless process where the mint simply melts the senders’ token and mints a new one for the recipient. Inter-mint transfers are facilitated through the “[Multimint Swap functionality](https://docs.cashu.space/faq#mints)”, which operates via Lightning invoices under the hood. A Lightning MPP (Multi-Path Payment) equivalent, called “Multinut Payments” has [recently been implemented](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1793554488806248839) in Cashu via [NUT15](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/15.md).
