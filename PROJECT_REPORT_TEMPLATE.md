# Bitcoin Layer/Infrastructure Project Report Template

## Instructions for Report Generation

This template serves as a comprehensive guide for generating detailed Bitcoin layer and infrastructure project reports. Follow this structure to ensure thorough analysis and consistent reporting across all reviews.

### üéØ CRITICAL: Research Sources Requirements

**Researchers MUST strictly use ONLY the following sources for analysis:**

1. **Official Project Documentation Sites** - The project's main documentation website(s)
2. **Official GitHub Repositories** - The project's code repositories, including:
   - Smart contracts and their verified source code
   - Technical specifications and READMEs
   - Issue discussions and pull requests
   - Release notes and changelogs

**DO NOT use:**
- Third-party analysis or reviews
- Social media posts or informal communications
- Unverified sources or speculation
- Marketing materials without technical backing

**Research Process:**
1. Start with the project's main documentation site
2. Review the official GitHub repositories for technical implementation details
3. Use blockchain explorers only for verifying on-chain data (contract addresses, transactions)
4. Cross-reference information between documentation and code implementation
5. When information conflicts, prioritize the most recent official source

### üîÑ Bitcoin Layers Review Snippet System

**CRITICAL: Use the existing snippet system for consistency across reviews:**

1. **Review Snippets** (`content/props-layers-reviews.ts`):
   - Contains reusable analysis content for the four trust assumption categories
   - Use existing snippets when analysis matches (e.g., `EthereumRollupDA`, `OperatorSidechainPOS`)
   - Create new snippets for novel patterns and add them to the enum

2. **Snippet Categories:**
   - **BTC Custody**: `CustodianPeg`, `FederationPeg`, `ThresholdtBTC`, `LiquidLBTC`, etc.
   - **Data Availability**: `EthereumRollupDA`, `AltL1DA`, `DAFederation`, `StatechainDABlindedServer`, etc.
   - **Network Operators**: `OperatorSidechainPOS`, `OperatorFederated`, `OperatorCentralizedStatechain`, etc.
   - **Settlement/Finality**: `CometBFTFinality`, `AltL1Finality`, `FinalityAnchorChain`, etc.

3. **Implementation Pattern:**
   ```typescript
   // In layer file:
   content: ReviewSnippet.YourSnippetName,
   ```

4. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive PascalCase names that indicate the technology pattern
   - Examples: `OperatorSidechainPOSBTCStake`, `AltRollupAltTokenFedFraudProofs`

**Benefits of this system:**
- Ensures consistent language across similar projects
- Makes updates easier (change snippet once, updates everywhere)
- Helps users compare projects with similar trust models
- Maintains quality and accuracy standards

## üö¶ Automated BTC Custody Review Initialization

**Step 1: Fetch and Review All Two-Way Pegs and Token Contracts**

- At the start of every review, automatically query the backend/database for all two-way pegs and token contract addresses associated with the project/layer.
- The review page will auto-populate the BTC Custody section with these pegs/contracts and display their latest analysis reports (from the analyzers) if available.
- For each new peg or token contract discovered, ensure it is added to the backend and run the appropriate analyzer (Bitcoin Transaction Analyzer for scripts/pegs, Token Analyzer for token contracts).
- If an analysis report is not yet available, queue or prompt for analysis and update the review once complete.
- This ensures the review always reflects the current set of custody mechanisms and their security analysis, minimizing manual work and omissions.

## üìã Methodology

### Analysis Framework
This report follows the Bitcoin Layers methodology, analyzing four core trust assumption categories:
1. **Bitcoin Custody** - How user funds are secured
2. **Network Operators** - Who operates the network
3. **Data Availability** - How transaction data is made available. Is data held client-side, does the network have its own full node implementation, or is it a rollup to another chain?
4. **Settlement Assurances** - How finality is achieved. Is the bitcoin network used as a checkpointing mechanism, or does the network rely on its own consensus for finality? 

### Tools & Data Sources

- **Manual Research:** [Documentation review, code inspection, etc.]
- **Data Sources:** [Blockchain explorers, project documentation, etc.]
- **Analysis Period:** [Time range of data analyzed]
