    "description": "Fedimint is a module-based open source framework for building federated applications, which can be collaboratively managed by a group of trusted entities. The main application that is in production today is an open source federated Ecash mint. The construction of a Fedimint sees users lock their BTC into a federation's multi-sig, and receive a bearer Ecash IOU in return. The concept improves on the currently predominant form of third party custody, as the user has a socially known and trusted entity guarding their BTC; a concept that is termed “second party custody”.",

Users explicitly trust the signers, known as guardians, of the federations’ multisig to not steal their funds. Stealing users’ funds needs a majority (e.g. 3/5 or 7/13) of guardians to collude. This is why “knowing your federation” is a key requirement when choosing second party custody."

That means, if you run a federation of 4 guardians you are resilient to 1 failing/malicious one, if you run a federation of 7 guardians, 2 of those can cease to be operational without it affecting the mint operation. A recent case of DNS issues caused 1 out of 4 guardians in a federation to be permanently offline which puts the federation at high risk to become non-functional."

The likelihood of that scenario is quite low because it's a multisig setup, which is resilient to several keys becoming inaccessible."

As such, there is the risk that a federation issues more claims on bitcoins than it actually holds, meaning that the liabilities (the issued Ecash tokens) exceed the actual assets (the bitcoin held in reserve). This discrepancy can lead to users being unable to redeem their (unbacked) tokens for bitcoin."
