While random, the overall value of a prospective signer's stake does impact the amount of key shares they receive in the threshold signing scheme. If a propsective signer hold a significant amount of stake (e.g. > 51%), there is a chance they could effectively gain unilateral control of a single bitcoin wallet.\n\nThis is currently mitigated by the fact that tBTC signing privileges are currently permissioned and signers must be approved by the Threshold DAO in its current set up. If tBTC signing privileges became permissionless, the mechanism could be vulernable to malicious parties acquiring a large amount of stake."

When a new wallet is created, a signer submits a sortition transaction to kick off a distributed key generation ceremony. The sortition pool then selects a number of signers to participate in the ceremony, generate a new wallet, and then distribute the private key shards across the group of signers.\n\nOnce the signers are distributed their individual key shares, they then participate is signing events via an offchain communication protocol."
