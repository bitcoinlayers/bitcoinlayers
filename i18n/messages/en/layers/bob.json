    "description": "BOB is an optimistic rollup that serves as an application layer for Bitcoin. They have launched as a rollup on top of Ethereum, with plans to derive more security from Bitcoin miners, and full nodes, over time. Its relation to Bitcoin, currently, is similar to that of a sidechain as it is an alternative consensus protocol with a two-way peg(s) between it and the Bitcoin mainchain.",

This Proof-of-Work validation would take minutes, so it can also act as a soft finalization mechanism as OP Stack chains typically take 7 days for the challenge period to finalize."
