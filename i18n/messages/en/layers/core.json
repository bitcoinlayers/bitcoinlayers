It uses a federated multisig to bridge BTC with multiple parties ensuring the honesty of the two-way peg. The native token of the network is CORE, which is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance in Core DAO.",

DPoS is performed by those who delegate their CORE tokens, or BTC, to select validators on Core Chain. A weighted score is assigned to a validator via the amount of Bitcoin hash rate and delegate stake they receive. The top 21 validators per this weighted score are the ones elected to participate in Core Chain consensus.\n\nValidators who are elected to participate in block production earn block rewards through newly issued CORE tokens and fees. Validators choose how much of these rewards they share with miners and delegators, if any, but are incentivized to share as much as possible to ensure that miners and delegators continue to select them for block production.\n\nBy separating Proof-of-Work mining from block production, Satoshi Plus is able to mitigate against MEV extraction from Bitcoin miners."
