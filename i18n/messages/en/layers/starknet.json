This would enable you to continuously add hashes of data to a merkle tree that continuously builds upon restrictions placed by previous transactions.\n\nBy building a continuous chain of restrictions over a number of transactions, you enable recursive covenants. Recursive covenants enable users to lock funds into a group UTXO that can continuously add more restrictions based on new user deposits, and additionally enforce changes for partial withdrawals which must go back into the rollup script."

The StarkWare team (lead developers of Starknet) are working with L2 Iterative Ventures on developing a STARK verifier directly in Bitcoin Script with OP_CAT.\n\nIn rollups, state differences are compressed together and sent to the Bitcoin L1 with a corresponding validity proof proving that the state transition was executed correctly. Starknet are proposing a mechanism that would verify these STARK proofs proving the validity of L2 state transitions. By verifying offchain state transitions directly in Script, shared UTXOs would be able to process user withdrawals based on their updated balances. Recursive covenants and onchain STARK verification would create trust-minimized bridge programs for L2s."

Cairo‚Äôs Turing-completeness allows it to emulate other VMs, which can then inherit provable characteristics on Starknet. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is one such example with Kakarot ZK-EVM, allowing EVM native transactions to be executed and proven on Starknet."

If Bitcoin miners have exclusive rights in ordering rollup transactions, especially those with more expressive execution environments, miners have opportunities to extract MEV through a variety of mechanisms. This is known as based sequencing. If Bitcoin rollups implemented based sequencing, miners could invest into more sophisticated block building infrastructure to extract more harmful MEV for increased profits. This could raise the barrier to entry for mining, and potentially introduce centralizing pressures.\n\nStarknet is currently sequenced (ordered) by a centralized sequencer. The Starknet community has additionally researched decentralized sequencer, but have focused on alternative consensus protocols taking on this role (CometBFT as an example).\n\nIf an alternative consensus mechanism is used to decentralize the sequencer, versus based sequencing, then MEV is unlikely to leak to Bitcoin miners."
