    "description": "The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is a network of connected subnet blockchains. It has a smart contract module, known as the Bitcoin Canister, that enables ICP smart contracts to have a view into Bitcoin state and conduct Bitcoin transactions. It additionally has a bitcoin-backed synthetic, known as ckBTC, which sees signers of a multi-sig scheme custody BTC and mint and burn synthetic ckBTC tokens on ICP. Developers can deploy a variety of applications leveraging the Bitcoin canister and ckBTC.",

Users can leverage their ckBTC on any ICP subnet per the applications they interact with. Users would initiate a “call” to a specific application on any given subnet and a boundary node would route that call accordingly. The contract would then receive the call, initiate the transaction, and see the transaction confirmed should 2 ⁄ 3 of node operators on the given subnet accept it. This sees liveness trust assumptions vary from subnet to subnet. Bitcoin-specific applications would additionally be dependent on the Bitcoin Canister which is on the ‘w4rem…’ subnet, operated by 13 nodes. The 22 Boundary Nodes are managed by a centralized development organization, the DFINITY Foundation."
