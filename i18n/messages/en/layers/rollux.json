At least one archive node needs to archive the full contents of the blob to ensure Rollux’s historical state is intact.\n\nAfter receiving a blob from Rollux, the UTXO chain attests to the availability of data to the NEVM chain.\n\nOnly one non-pruned online node is needed to reconstruct the entire state of Syscoin and Rollux."

This combined with miners earning a portion of transaction fees and newly issued SYS tokens from Syscoin block mining creates an incentive for providing security to both BTC and to Syscoin."
