    "description": "The Liquid Network is a sidechain that enables users to perform confidential transactions, swaps, issue tokenized assets, and more, on the sidechain. It is managed by a permissioned federation, and does not use the Bitcoin Layer 1 for security. It uses a federated multi-sig to custody the BTC that is used to issue BTC IOUs (L-BTC) on the sidechain.",
