They are using zkSTARKs to prove rollup state transitions and will use Bitcoin for data availability. Citrea is being developed by Chainway Labs.",

The design sees a fixed operator and verifier set maintain the integrity of its two-way peg.\n\nMultiple operators at the same time manage the withdrawals and deposits from the bridge program. In the event that one of the operators is dishonest, verifiers (who are from the federated verifier set) can initiate a challenge transaction and dispute the malicious operator's withdrawal transactions.\n\nOperators in this set front liquidity for user withdrawals and are able to redeem funds used for processed withdawals from the bridge program after a specific time period.\n\nClementime improves the trust assumption of bridge programs from trusting a majority of operators to trusting a single operator for its liveness and single verifier for its safety."
