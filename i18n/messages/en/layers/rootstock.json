    "description": "Rootstock is a merge-mined, EVM-compatible bitcoin sidechain. As a merge-mined network, bitcoin miners can concurrently mine for Rootstock's consensus. The network is not secured by another token. As an EVM-compatible network, developers can deploy Solidity and other EVM-compatible smart contracts with arbitrary logic, creating a host of new applications for BTC. Rootstock has an enshrined cross-chain BTC asset called ''Smart Bitcoin'' (RBTC), which is pegged 1:1 to BTC and secured by a permissioned multisig federation.",

Essentially, BTC mining pools add references to Rootstock blocks in mining jobs sent to mining participants. Additionally, because the Rootstock mining algorithm is the same as bitcoin’s, there is little added energy expenditure. This combined with miners earning a portion of transaction fees from Rootstock block mining creates an incentive for providing security to both BTC and to Rootstock.\n\nCurrently, more than 50% of the bitcoin hashrate is participating in Rootstock merged mining. Rootstock Labs states to have three phases for merged mining growth, a bootstrap phase (<30% of BTC hashrate), stable phase (60% ≥ Rootstock ≥ 30%), and its mature phase (≥60%). Currently, Rootstock is in its stable phase.\n\nIn order to pay out miners, every block executes the Reward Manager Smart Contract (REMASC). The contract keeps record of the Reward Balance account, which exists to change value during new block production. When a block reaches maturity, the appropriate portions of rewards are distributed according to REMASC specified rules."

The Powpeg functionaries are: BlockVenture, Collider, Constata, Luxor, MyCointainer, pNetwork, Rootstock Labs, Sovryn, and Xapo.\n\nEach functionary operates a Powpeg node. A Powpeg node combines a specialized Rootstock full node with a Proof of Work Hardware Security Module (PowHSM). A PowHSM is a hardware device designed to remove human control over the bitcoin private keys used to sign Powpeg multisig transactions. PowHSM operators cannot manually sign transactions, extract private keys, or perform any other functions with the private keys. The PowHSM firmware is open source and available in the Rootstock GitHub repo. PowHSM operators are publicly verifiable using remote attestation.\n\nRequests by users to withdraw BTC from the Powpeg bridge must be approved by a majority of Powpeg functionaries. If a functionary's PowHSM is online, then it will automatically sign a withdrawal transaction after the withdrawal request reaches a sufficient number of confirmations on the Rootstock blockchain.\n\nBTC held in the Powpeg bridge can be stolen if a majority of PowHSM devices are compromised.\n\nAdditionally, the Powpeg uses a time-locked emergency 3-of-4 federated multisig as a safeguard against PowHSM device failures or possible external intervention. The emergency multisig automatically gains spending authority over the funds in the Powpeg bridge if a majority of PowHSM devices are unresponsive for a period of one year. The emergency multisig signers are: Rootstock Labs, MoneyOnChain, Jameson Lopp, and Adrian Eidelman. In the event of an emergency, these signatories will evaluate the situation and coordinate for the recovery of funds.\n\nBTC held in the emergency multisig can be lost or stolen if a majority of the emergency multisig signers are compromised.\n\nIf BTC held in the Powpeg bridge (or emergency multisig, if the emergency multisig procedure has been activated) is lost or stolen, then users will not be able to convert RBTC to BTC and exit the bridge.\n\nTo potentially improve the trust assumptions of the Rootstock bitcoin bridge, Rootstock Labs is funding research into BitVMX, a protocol that can be used to develop a trust-minimized 1-of-N federated bitcoin bridge."
