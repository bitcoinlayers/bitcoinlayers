## Using our research

If you're building any materials, platforms or websites related to #bitcoin L2s and sidechains, you're welcome to use Bitcoin Layers research. Everything we release is free and open-source under an MIT license. We kindly ask that you reference this project with a link to the domain bitcoinlayers.org.

## How to add a project

Example for a layer:

1. Create a new [layername].ts file by copying the template.ts file. Please include as much information around the project as you can.
2. Add the project to /util/layer_index.tsx by copy-pasting the import and declaration, using new name format from Step 1
3. Add to the array of all layers
4. Add project logo to public/logos. Please ensure that the file's name matches the "slug" in the [layername].ts file and is in png format
5. Submit a PR and prosper ðŸ˜Ž

To add an 'infrastructure' (e.g., a BTC wrapper), repeat the same processes substituting `layer` for `infrastructure`
