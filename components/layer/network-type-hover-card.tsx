    [EntityType.Rollup]: {
        name: "Rollup",
        description: "A modular blockchain that uses a parent blockchain for data availability. The blockchain stores its state root and enough transaction data to reconstruct the state of the blockchain from genesis in the parent blockchain."
    },
    [EntityType.Sidechain]: {
        name: "Sidechain",
        description: "An L1 that exists to add more functionality to BTC the asset. L1s are sovereign in technical architecture but typically exist as subsets of the broader bitcoin ecosystem. It's common for sidechains to enshrine a BTC bridge into their consensus mechanisms or involve bitcoin miners in consensus - through merge mining or fee sharing."
    },
    [EntityType.Statechain]: {
        name: "Statechain",
        description: "A protocol where users enter a 2-2 multisig with a federated entity and transfer ownership of a UTXO to an intended recipient by providing them a statechain private key for that specific UTXO."

    [EntityType.StateChannel]: {
        name: "State Channel",
        description: "A type of L2 scaling solution that allows participants to conduct transactions offchain, in a faster and cheaper environment. Only the state differentials (i.e., the start state and the end state) are recorded on the blockchain, reducing the load on the main network and by extension, the fees required. Unlike rollups, state channels do not have a 'global state' and instead exist as a series of bilateral agreements between participants."

        description: "A rollup implementation that sovereignly manages its own execution environment, and does not have a canonical bridge with its parent blockchain. Rollups on bitcoin are technically sovereign rollups, even if they have a socially enshrined two-way peg."

    [EntityType.AltRollup]: {
        name: "Alternative Rollup",
        description: "An alternative rollup (alt. rollup) is a modular blockchain that uses a parent blockchain for data availability. The blockchain stores its state root and enough transaction data to reconstruct the state of the blockchain from genesis in the parent blockchain. An alternative rollup does not use bitcoin for data availability."

        name: "Ethereum Rollup",
        description: "A rollup that uses Ethereum as its data availability layer and settles transactions on the Ethereum network."
    },
    [EntityType.SidechainRollup]: {
        name: "Sidechain Rollup",
        description: "A hybrid approach that combines sidechain and rollup technologies for enhanced scalability and functionality."
    },
    [EntityType.Anchor]: {
        name: "Anchor Chain",
        description: "An anchor chain is a blockchain that posts its latest state root to bitcoin and requires its block produces to build upon that latest state root. This sees anchor chain transactions inherit additional double-spend resistance from bitcoin."
    },
    [EntityType.ChaumianEcashProtocol]: {
        name: "Chaumian Ecash Protocol",
        description: "A digital cash protocol that provides anonymity and privacy for electronic transactions."
